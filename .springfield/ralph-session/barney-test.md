## Test Results

### Five-Second Test
- Result: PASS
- Notes: *burp* The video on the home page starts playing right away - I can see food being prepared. The orange "Get a Free Quote" button is super obvious. I know this is a catering website immediately!

### No-Reading Test
- Result: PASS
- Notes: Even without reading anything, I can:
  - See delicious food videos playing
  - Find the big orange buttons to click
  - Navigate using the menu at the top
  - See Chef Yaya's face on the contact page (she looks friendly!)

### Wrong-Click Test
- Result: PASS
- Notes: Clicked around randomly on images - nothing broke! The scrolling gallery on testimonials paused when I hovered (nice touch). Videos just keep looping - no confusing error states.

### Interruption Test
- Result: PASS
- Notes: I got "distracted" looking at the oxtails picture for like... a while. When I came back, everything was still working. Videos kept playing, pages stayed where they were.

## Barney's Thoughts
*BURRRP* Hey, I actually figured everything out! The videos make me hungry. The Chef lady looks like she knows what she's doing. All the food pictures are REAL food - not that fake stock photo stuff that looks too perfect.

If I can navigate this website after a few beers at Moe's, anyone can! The buttons are big, the videos are cool, and I didn't get lost once.

*burp* Time to celebrate with another Duff!
